  Amity Gardens was preceded by Charlotte’s Hollywood neighborhood built in the
  1920’s. The majority of houses in Amity Gardens were built in the mid 1950’s
  by Ervin Construction. As Charlotte has grown over the past 60 years, the
  neighborhood has retained its charm, remaining a cozy residential retreat
  minutes from downtown. The neighborhood features large yards, easy access to
  Independence Boulevard, friendly residents, and a beautiful landscape.
  Oakhurst STEAM Academy, our neighborhood school, is within walking distance,
  and Cotswold Shopping Center is a brief drive away. Amity Gardens offers the
  convenience and excitement of living in a major metropolitan city with the
  community and appeal of a peaceful, family-friendly neighborhood.
