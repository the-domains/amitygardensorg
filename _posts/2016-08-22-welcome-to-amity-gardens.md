# Welcome to Amity Gardens

Official Website of the Amity Gardens Neighborhood in east Charlotte, NC

_Where community and nature come to life..._

Amity Gardens is one of the most accurately named neighborhoods in Charlotte as we're home to a vibrant, supportive community of beauty. With rising property values, a thriving neighborhood school, and low crime rates, Amity Gardens is one of the best kept secrets in Charlotte. There are many shops, restaurants, and churches within walking distance of our neighborhood. Cotswold, Downtown Charlotte, and Southpark are a quick drive away, and access to Independence is even closer.
